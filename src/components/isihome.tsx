            Full of natural charm, our bespoke oak framed buildings are a dream for
            homeowners, architects, designers and developers alike. Oak is
            wonderfully tactile – unique in its texture, warmth, and character –
            but it’s also strong, versatile, and desirably sustainable, especially
            crafted using centuries-old techniques and 21st-century methods such
            as encapsulation (SIPs).
